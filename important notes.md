The `index.html` file is usually the entry point for static sites, but in a Next.js app, the structure is different.

### Next.js Static Export

If you want to serve a Next.js application through NGINX, you'll need to either:

1. **Export as Static Site**: Use `next export` to generate a static version of your Next.js app. You can do this by adding a script in your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "export": "next export"
   }
   ```

   Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm run export
   ```

   This will create an `out` directory with the static files. Update your Dockerfile to copy from this directory:

   ```dockerfile
   COPY --from=builder /app/out /usr/share/nginx/html/
   ```

2. **Serve the Next.js Server**: If you want to keep using Next.js features (like server-side rendering), you would run your Next.js app directly instead of using NGINX. You can change your Dockerfile to:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build

   FROM node:18-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app ./
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

   Then, run your container without NGINX:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 next-app
   ```

Choose the method that best fits your use case. If you need further assistance, let me know!

To serve a Next.js application as a static site using NGINX, you can use `next export`. Here’s how you can adjust your Dockerfile:

1. Update your `package.json` to include the `export` script.
2. Modify your Dockerfile to build and export your app.

### Step 1: Update `package.json`

Add the export script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "export": "next export",  // Add this line
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```

### Step 2: Modify the Dockerfile

Here’s an example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use the Node.js 18 Alpine image for building
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
RUN npm run export  # Build and export the app

# Use NGINX to serve the exported files
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/out /usr/share/nginx/html  # Adjust the path
COPY ./conf /etc/nginx/conf.d
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Explanation:

- The `RUN npm run export` command generates a static version of your site in the `out` directory (the default output directory for `next export`).
- The `COPY --from=builder /app/out /usr/share/nginx/html` line copies the static files into the NGINX HTML directory.

After updating the Dockerfile, you can rebuild your Docker image and run it. Make sure to visit `http://localhost:80` (or the port you specified) to see your Next.js application.
